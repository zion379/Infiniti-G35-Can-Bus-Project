# Infiniti-G35-Can-Bus-Project
 This is a project to add more modern features to the Infiniti G35. Using the can bus network to view vital information on the car in realtime. 

The Current State of the project is figuring out the canbus speed of the infiniti G35. I have done some research on fourms and discovered that potential protocal that is used is ISO 15765-4 CAN (1 bit ID, 250 kbaud)
